Testing is like more code. 
Suppose we have a function that returns 5. how do we ensure that this function is correctly written
At the heart of testing is comparing expected output versus actual output.

Testing could be:  Unit test, Deterministic Function.

How do we compare expected output vs actual output?

We write somethig like this: => expect five().toBe(5)

The testing library would find this line, run it, and would inform you whether this was the case or not.
If the test runner picks up that line, runs it, and the output is 4, it would return a fail .

There is no scientific way that we can that can think of where a function is right except through testing

Make sure your functions have a side-effect: returning values or doing something.

Your test files should be placed in the _test_ named folder. They should also have the extension .test.js
